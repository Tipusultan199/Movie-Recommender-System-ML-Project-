Report: Movie Recommendation Model Using Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering Approaches
Dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
Introduction:
In this report, we discuss the development and evaluation of a movie recommendation model using machine learning techniques. The model utilizes both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to provide personalized movie recommendations. The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of two datasets: tmdb_5000_credits and tmdb_5000_movies, which were obtained from Kaggle.

Data Overview:
The tmdb_5000_credits dataset contains information about the movie credits, including cast and crew members, while the tmdb_5000_movies dataset provides details about the movies, such as title, genres, and popularity. These datasets serve as the foundation for building our movie recommendation model.

Content-Based Movie Recommender:
The first approach we implemented is a content-based movie recommender. This technique focuses on the attributes of movies to recommend similar movies. We extracted relevant features from the dataset, such as movie genres, keywords, and popularity. We then used these features to compute similarity scores between movies and recommend movies with high similarity scores.

To build the content-based recommender, we performed the following steps:

Preprocessed and cleaned the data, ensuring data consistency and quality.
Extracted relevant features from the dataset, such as movie genres, keywords, and popularity.
Applied appropriate data transformations and feature engineering techniques to represent the movies.
Utilized similarity measures, such as cosine similarity, to calculate the similarity between movies based on their features.
Recommended movies with the highest similarity scores to the user based on their selected movie.
Collaborative Filtering:
The second approach we implemented is collaborative filtering, which recommends movies based on the preferences and behavior of similar users. This technique assumes that users with similar preferences in the past are likely to have similar preferences in the future. Collaborative filtering can be further classified into two types: user-based and item-based.

For our movie recommendation model, we employed item-based collaborative filtering, which involves finding similarities between movies based on user ratings. The steps involved in building the collaborative filtering recommender are as follows:

Preprocessed and cleaned the data, handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
Created a user-item matrix, where rows represent users and columns represent movies, with the cells containing the ratings given by users.
Calculated similarity scores between movies based on user ratings, typically using measures like cosine similarity.
Predicted ratings for movies that users have not yet seen by using weighted averages of ratings from similar movies.
Recommended movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.
Evaluation and Performance:
To evaluate the movie recommendation model, we employed appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. We split the dataset into training and test sets, ensuring that movies and user ratings were appropriately divided. We measured how well the model predicted user preferences by comparing the recommended movies to the movies the user actually rated.

The model's performance was further assessed by collecting feedback from users through surveys or feedback mechanisms within the application. This feedback helped us understand the effectiveness of the recommendations and identify areas for improvement.

Conclusion:
In this report, we presented a movie recommendation model that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. By leveraging movie attributes and user behavior, the model generates personalized movie recommendations. The content-based approach focuses on movie features, while collaborative filtering relies on user ratings and preferences. By using a combination of these approaches, we aim to provide accurate and diverse movie recommendations to enhance the user experience.

The model's effectiveness and performance were evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and user feedback. Based on the evaluation results, we can make iterative improvements to the model and enhance the recommendation algorithm further.# Movie-Recommender-System-ML-Project-
